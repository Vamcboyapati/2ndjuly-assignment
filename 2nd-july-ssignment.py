# 1 What are variables and why are they called variables
#A variable is typically described as a name that refers to a specific block of memory and they are called "variables" because the value they store can be changed or varied in incoming lines of code.
 
#Assign two numbers to variables `a` and `b`, and print their sum.
a=18
b=7
print(a+b)

# 2.Write a Python program to subtract two numbers and print the result
18
7
print(18-7)

# 3.Multiply two variables and store the result in a third variable. Print all three.
a=18
b=7
c=a*b
print(a,b,c)

# 4.Divide 10 by 3 and print the result with and without decimals
print(10/3)
print(10//3)

# Use floor division `//` to divide 17 by 4. Print the output.
print(17//4)

# 6. Use the modulo operator `%` to check the remainder when 25 is divided by 6.
print(25%6)

# 7. Calculate and print the square of a number stored in a variable.
a=18
print(a**2)

# 8. Assign values to three variables `x`, `y`, `z` and compute the average.
x,y,z=18,7,45
average=x+y+z/3
print(average)

# 9. Take a number and find its cube using the `**` operator.
print(18**3)

# 10. Create two variables `length` and `width`. Calculate and print area of a rectangle.
length=18
width=7
area_of_a_rectangle=length*width
print(area_of_a_rectangle)

# 11. Assign a variable `total_marks = 450` and `obtained_marks = 375`. Find percentage.
total_marks=450
obtained_marks=375
percentage=(obtained_marks/total_marks)*100
print(percentage)

# 12. Write a Python statement that calculates `(a + b) * c` for some values of a, b, and c.
a=18
b=7
c=45
print((a+b)*c)

# 13. Draw and show how reassignment changes variable reference to a memory block.
